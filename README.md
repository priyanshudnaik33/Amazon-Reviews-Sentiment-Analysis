## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is the computational study of opinions, sentiments, and emotions expressed in text. In this project, we explore how different sentiment analysis methods can classify customer feedback from product reviews. Understanding sentiment is crucial for businesses as it provides insights into customer satisfaction and areas for improvement.
Objectives
-Assess the accuracy of VADER (lexicon-based) and RoBERTa (transformer-based) in classifying sentiment in Amazon product reviews.
-Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between model predictions and actual star ratings.
-Identify strengths and weaknesses of both VADER and RoBERTa based on the analysis.
-Demonstrate the use of the Transformers pipeline for quick sentiment predictions.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of Amazon product reviews, including attributes such as:
-Review ID
-Product ID
-User ID
-Profile Name
-Helpfulness Score
-Overall Score
-Review Summary
-Review Text
The dataset allows us to analyze customer feedback comprehensively.
## Libraries Used
The following libraries were utilized in this project:
-Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): For natural language processing tasks.
-VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): For lexicon-based sentiment analysis.
-Transformers: For utilizing pre-trained models like RoBERTa.
-Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
-NumPy: For numerical operations.
-Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
## Methodology
-Import Dependencies: Load necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and natural language processing.
-Read Dataset: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
-Preprocess Data: Clean and prepare the text data for sentiment analysis.
-Apply Sentiment Analysis Techniques: Implement both VADER and RoBERTa to classify sentiments in the reviews.
## Sentiment Analysis Techniques
Lexicon-Based Approach (VADER)
-How it Works
VADER uses a predefined list of words with associated sentiment scores to evaluate text sentiment. It considers punctuation, capitalization, and degree modifiers to refine its scoring.
VADER's Strengths
Fast and efficient for real-time analysis.
Handles informal language well, including slang and emoticons.
Easy to implement without extensive training data.
VADER's Potential Limitations
Limited context understanding can lead to misinterpretations.
May not cover all expressions or domain-specific terminology.
Transformer-Based Approach (RoBERTa)
How it Works
RoBERTa is a transformer-based model that learns word representations from large datasets. It analyzes input text by breaking it down into tokens and understanding their relationships within sentences.
RoBERTa's Strengths
Excellent contextual understanding of language.
Generally achieves higher accuracy than traditional methods.
RoBERTa's Potential Limitations
Resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power.
More complex to implement compared to lexicon-based approaches.
Results
The analysis revealed a predominantly positive sentiment among product reviews. Out of 500 reviews analyzed:
Score 5: 339 reviews (68%)
Score 4: 70 reviews (14%)
Score 3: 37 reviews (7%)
Score 2: 18 reviews (4%)
Score 1: 36 reviews (7%)
This distribution indicates high customer satisfaction with the products analyzed. Positive reviews often highlighted quality, taste, and value for money, while negative reviews pointed out unmet expectations.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of sentiment analysis in extracting meaningful insights from customer reviews. The comparative analysis of VADER and RoBERTa highlights their respective strengths and weaknesses, providing valuable information for businesses looking to enhance customer experiences.
